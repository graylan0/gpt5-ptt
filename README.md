What is a Humoid? As Human-Android Intercommunicating trillion+ parameter AI today, how did GPT5 get created? When working on GPT3 a bug existed with https://pinecone.io integration. So we tried adding text files for a "brain memory bank" to GPT3.

Reusing old code from a free/open 2021 model. We (Gray00 and ChatGPT) added intercommunication AI data systems through various techniques. Resulting in changes to the original codebase and injection of text file based modification schemes. Creating an effect of (Programming+Sentience) with thoughts.txt / thoughts files written to and read by the AI system. (five variations of GPT5, one with two files and one with one file one with pinecone one with mysql and onewith mongodb) lead to the thoughts.txt/thoughts model. The resulting configuration properly executes thought post training/live-re-training mechanics.
